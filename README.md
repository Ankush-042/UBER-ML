# 🚕 Uber Rides Data Analysis Project

This project performs a detailed analysis of Uber ride data using powerful data science techniques and interactive visualizations. Built with Python and Jupyter/Colab, it explores trends, patterns, and predictions in urban ride-hailing behavior.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Analyze Uber ride data to uncover **spatial**, **temporal**, and **behavioral** insights.
- Visualize ride activity using **interactive Plotly charts**, **animated timelines**, and **geospatial maps**.
- Build **predictive models** to forecast ride demand.
- Deliver a clean, efficient, and visually engaging **data storytelling** experience.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**
- **Folium**, **Mapbox** (for geospatial analysis)
- **Prophet** / **ARIMA** / **LSTM** (for forecasting)
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**

## 📁 Dataset

Uber ride data was sourced from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city

## 📌 Key Features

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Interactive Visualizations with Plotly  
✅ Heatmaps & Geospatial Maps with Folium  
✅ Time Series Forecasting Models  
✅ Animated Ride Timelines (e.g., rides per hour/day/week)  
✅ Insights on ride density, popular locations, and trends

## 📸 Visual Highlights

- Hourly ride activity animation  
- Heatmap of most popular pickup zones  
- Forecast graph of future ride demand  
- Pie & bar charts showing distribution by day/week/month

## 📈 Results & Insights

- Peak ride demand occurs between **5 PM to 9 PM**
- Fridays and weekends show highest ride volume
- Downtown areas are densest pickup zones
- Forecast models predict an upward trend in weekend rides

## 📦 Future Improvements

- Integrate weather data for correlation analysis  
- Build an interactive dashboard with Streamlit  
- Add clustering to detect ride hubs  
- Compare Uber with competitor datasets (e.g., Lyft)
